          <p>YummyPixels was born when food photographer Paul Brighton and his wife and food stylist, Thais, realised that their photo shoot sessions conveyed their love for the food they tasted during their travels around the world.</p>
          <p>The world’s diversity can easily be verified by the way each ethnic group cooks, as this is a long-lasting identifier of their culture.</p>
          <p>There are loads of recipe and travel websites out there that are quite annoying to read as they are full of adverts and unrelated content. At YummyPixels, it’s just plain old recipes that are easy to follow and some travel itineraries that might inspire you to start changing the way you plan your next trip abroad.</p>
