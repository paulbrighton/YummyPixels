        <p>I have travelled through Africa and South East Asia for five months, lived in Brazil for a year and travelled through the Amazon for a month and now I take two to three-week trips as often as possible to the destinations I need to check off my list.</p>
        <p>I want to share with you some of my past and maybe future travel itineraries that should help you planning your next trip, be it a twelve-month gap year trip or that two week escape from normality.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™d like to start by sharing with you my trip to Japan and South Korea that I did in 2014, not only did I get to see Japan but also return to South Korea for some Korean BBQ and checkout some of the sites I missed the first time I visited. The trip includes Tokyo, Kyoto and Seoul along with other interesting places in Japan to visit, all in just over two weeks.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye on the Travel page as I will be updating it regularly with more travel inspiration.</p>
